    "# Fine Grained Authorization for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Building \"enterprise-ready AI\" requires ensuring that users can only augment prompts with data they are authorized to access. Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) is particularly well-suited for fine-grained authorization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). ReBAC allows you to generate a list of resources that a specific user has permission to access (e.g., a list of documents that a user has permission to view). This capability enables you to pre-filter vector database queries with a list of authorized object IDs, improving both efficiency and security. Moreover, ReBAC excels at fine-grained authorization because it makes decisions based on the relationships between objects, offering more precise control compared to traditional models like RBAC and ABAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG with ReBAC Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a practical example of implementing fine-grained authorization for RAG using Pinecone, Langchain, OpenAI, and SpiceDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Access to a [SpiceDB](https://authzed.com/spicedb) instance and API key. (This example uses insecure connections to a locally running SpiceDB instance. You can find examples of using a secure client [here](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-py?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage).)\n",
    "- A [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) account and API key.\n",
    "- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running SpiceDB\n",
    "Follow the [install guide](https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/getting-started/installing-spicedb) for your platform and run a local instance of SpiceDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "```spicedb serve --grpc-preshared-key rag-rebac-walkthrough```\n",

    "### Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough requires the following environment variables. The easiest way to set these is with a .env file in your working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```OPENAI_API_KEY=<add OpenAI key>```\n",
    "- ```PINECONE_API_KEY=<add Pinecone key>```\n",
    "- ```SPICEDB_API_KEY=rag-rebac-walkthrough```\n",
    "- ```SPICEDB_ADDR=localhost:50051```"
